Besides, I can be the team leader as I prefer using traditional techniques to solve problems therefore it may save time for the whole team and I am also an analytical person with an emotionally stable so that I can work easily as a team by receiving energy from my teammates.</p>
                                                    <p class="tm-text tm-home-description">FEEDBACK FROM MY PEERS: Based on my peers’ reviews, I can now acknowledge what my project’s strengths and weaknesses are. They all love my project idea as creating a simple arcade game might be suitable for individual work and the idea by using the five attributes is also a plus point for the project. However, they also point out the weaknesses in my project idea. Firstly, the explanation of the game mechanics is not complete and not clear enough for players to understand. For this complaint, I agree with their idea on how lack of information in the description of my game is and for future improvement, I will try to make it clearer and add some more new special features to make my game project more attractive. Secondly, they also advised me to build up the storyline to make the game more coherent and engaging and it would be easier to build events based on the storyline. I will consider building and bringing the story into the game since the idea is also great. However, it's been difficult for me to develop this game by myself, so maybe I'll add more storylines when I have enough help and capacity. Another thread of opinion is that I am going against the trend of the game in the world. In this regard, I completely disagree with this opinion because after Covid-19, everyone's gaming demand increases quite high and among the top of the most attractive games in recent times is Among Us, Werewolves online, uno online, etc. And most of these games have a fairly simple design in terms of graphics and its appeal is huge due to the gameplay and innovative game mechanics.</p>

Video games have already been an integral part in today world not only during covid-19 period but also for daily entertainment demand of people. Therefore, developing a game to meet that demand is an interesting idea to make. In summary, this project focuses mainly on building up a game using tools to meet the demand during the pandemic.</p>

Those examples prove that entertainment industry is an attractive and potentially and limitless in developing today and the near future. Moreover, as a player, I want to create my own masterpiece that everyone can join, play and enjoy it together during leisure times. Games can be developed by various tools such as Unity, Cocos2d, etc.</p>

                                                    <p class="tm-text tm-home-description">There are various advantages while choosing to make an arcade game. Firstly, when doing this project individually, it is an affordable choice for individuals who want to work independently as it does not have to be too fussy in its graphics but primarily for a compelling content that can easily attract players. According to the Forbes (2014), Flappy bird was created in just only two days by a Vietnamese game-creator called Dong Nguyen that brought back $50,000 for him as this game is free to play due to the number of more than 50 million users throughout its heyday. Secondly, “instant” arcade games seem not to be less time consuming in comparison with online PC games and they are suitable to play during short break periods. Most of the “instant” arcade games are not too focused on building up the plot content or seem to be, the game experience will become more flexible and easier because the player will not need to spend too much time for learn about games before playing them. Moreover, such “instant” games take a very little time to experience, the maximum will be 15-20 minutes for around 5-6 attemps, compared to online games like “League of Legends” or PUBG, it usually wastes around 30 to 60 mins for 1 attempt experience only. Nevertheless, games with simple graphics will decrease the amount of data capacity that will save memory for mobiles in comparison with high graphic ones. Simple graphics games not only take less space in storing but also helps developers optimize funding for game production. Lastly, the simpler the graphics, the more appealing to players based on the trend of today's gaming market.</p>
                                                    <p class="tm-text tm-home-description">This project idea is named the “FiBE” game that will be created for mobile use only. This game project is mainly based on the five basic elements which are metal, wood, water, fire & earth. The player's task is to control the character across the areas and terrain that possesses the five elements. Players can also customize their own five elements to suit the current terrain. For example, if the current terrain of the game is wood, the player must use the character of the fire attribute to get through this level. Note, the pace and difficulty of the game will increase with the level of each level in the game.</p>
                                                    <p class="tm-text tm-home-description">On the other hand, there are many difficulties for this project to be done and the biggest barrier is the lack of skills and techniques to finalize my project. Due to the complexity of the game making steps, I need to learn and practice more in the next 2-3 years in order to achieve enough knowledge to make my own game. At the moment, ideas are just simply ideas.</p>

Besides, I can also use Python to calculate the difficulty of each level in the game and from there I can use the parameters and adjust the game and bring it to the most balanced version.</p>

In addition, learning how to use Unity as the game making tool also plays a significant role while developing a game. Nevertheless, searching skill is also necessary in this project as you need to find the suitable sound effects for my project. However, fortunately, most of the tools and technologies needed for building up a game can be found online and free to use.</p>

                                                    <p class="tm-text tm-home-description">Since the beginning of the industrial revolution 4.0 period up to now, cloud computing and cybersecurity become integral parts of the development of today world. According to the Microsoft (2020),  cloud computing is the most popular storage tool for over half of the century with many magnificent advantages including cost efficiency, flexibility, agility and globally scale (Microsoft 2020). There are 4 types of cloud services, for example, Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS) and Software as a service (SaaS) (Stephan & Frank 2018). In fact, cloud computing has already been on its heyday from the early 1960s till now and in the future, its position will remain unchanged. Unless human might create some kind of “space computing” or “universe computing” that might threaten the cloud’s position with bigger data storage and more efficient technologies go along with them. In fact, cloud computing changes the way people store their data significantly due to the disappearance of CDs, USBs, memory disks and so on. Cloud computing is suitable with various range of career, especially, with the game development area. In addition, in the near future, cloud computing is predicted to expand in its influence. According to Goodison (2020), in 2019, the partnership between Oracle and Microsoft opens up the opportunity and idea for the creation of the concept of multi-cloud and joint clouds for the future. Such a combination solves the limitations of each company in leveraging the cloud and at the same time linking each other's strengths to form an absolute competitor in the business environment (Goodison 2020). She also mentions about the optimization and orchestration of automated cloud and organizations securely move their data to the cloud, which means cloud migration and data privacy still have an integral part in the near future.</p>

                                                    <p class="tm-text tm-home-description">Cloud computing is suitable with most of the other careers due to the cost efficiency by making good use of the unlimitedness in cloud storage. According to Stephan & Frank (2018), consumers can make good use of the cloud’s infrastructure to reduce the cost of normal storage way as running a data centre that contain the cost of cooling, construction of buildings, power and so on. Moreover, an example from Ryoo (2015) shows that at any particular moment, PayPal handles more than 1.1 million gigabytes of data for more than 150 million user accounts and one million gigabytes of data equal to more than 200.000 DVDs as this may also be a strain on the computing resources of an enterprise. A prediction shows that there are six fields, namely IT, social media, retailing, insurance, agriculture and financial services depend on cloud computing due to the flexibility of the cloud in connection with AI, the Internet of Things and machine learning (Cohen 2016, as cited in Alderton 2019). In fact, in today world, more and more careers are likely to depend on cloud computing but not just only the six fields listed above.</p>

                                                    <p class="tm-text tm-home-description">With the help of cloud computing, my project might turn from an offline to an online game one day. Besides, I can build up my own game server with the data stored on the cloud including game data, players’ information and other data that relates to game developments, feedbacks from players, updates and so on. Moreover, the scale of my project is likely to be expanded as it will become an open world game with loads of new features if I use the cloud computing. Furthermore, daily backing up data from my phone to iCloud seems to become an indispensable habit for me to start a new day so that I can avoid ridiculous situations in life such as losing or broken my phone or laptop. In fact, each person will have their own ways to use cloud computing. For me, however, I often forget things, therefore, most of my personal information is stored inside my phone; reminders and contacts help me a lot in remember important things. To sum up, instead of using handwritten diaries, I prefer using cloud computing to store my own information and I can easily recall them as anytime as I want with my phone always besides me.</p>

                                                    <p class="tm-text tm-home-description">In the industrial revolution 4.0 era, the existence of cyber security becomes the most significant solution for remaining and protecting the cloud computing and other IT aspects at the same time. There are many different kinds of cyber threats such as malware, phishing, ransomware and so on (Taylor 2020). The major issues to cybersecurity today are cybercrimes, cyber-attacks and cyber terrorism by disrupting or unlawfully infiltrating infrastructure with malicious codes to leak data or to earn income (Kaspersky 2020). Malware, which is classified as a malicious software, is the world’s most prevalent cyber hazard by damaging user’s devices. It is also camouflaged as an email attachment or a software download for making profits or political assaults (Kaspersky 2020). There are various types of malware (Taylor 2020). According to the Kaspersky (2020), cyber security, which is known as computer security or IT security, is defined as the prevention of computers, mobiles, severs, … from anonymous attacks. Cyber security includes network security, information security, application security and so on (Kaspersky 2020). The fact is that the existence of cyber security is endless as it is a guard to protect people from cyber threats. In fact, in order to improve cybersecurity, the United States spends around $ 10 billion annually, and the figure is increasingly growing year by year (Dean 2015). Network users can secure their information through (Goel 2018).</p>

                                                    <p class="tm-text tm-home-description">The reality is that every year, cyberattacks inflict billions of US dollars in harm and directly impact every industry engaged in the use of computers and networks. The more popular cloud computing becomes, the more important the existence of cyber security is. Besides, online users care a lot about their online privacy while searching and updating their personal information onto social media. Many websites and apps track their own users’ data and sell that information. Moreover, hackers can easily hack into their personal devices by using viruses or malwares. In addition, cyber security in today world is extremely important therefore the number of cyber security jobs keep increasing. However, there are various anti-virus applications developed in order to keep the data safe such as Kaspersky, BKAV, CleanMyMac and so on. Today, approximately 25% of users use VPN as a method to protect their devices when linking to Wi-Fi hotspots, depending on the publisher's protection commitments.  The reality, however, is that users have no means of checking a VPN's security, and one research has shown that most VPN publishers trick their clients (Khan & Rodriguez 2019). Lastly, about the employment, with the budget up to $ 10 billion from the US, we can see how big this industry is – cybersecurity industry. Thus, more job opportunities are created in the near future as the number of data keeps increasing days by days goes along with the demand of data protection from cyber-attacks.</p>

                                                    <p class="tm-text tm-home-description">In daily life, it is extremely easy to see fake emails and free application traps. For me, as I used to be a victim of various types of malware, I now have enough knowledge to stay away from them. However, for my family and friends, it is a different story as my parents, they both use network daily for their job and web surfing, therefore, they might become victims of those traps one day. As an online user, I care a lot about how to secure my personal information because I saved most of my data inside my phone and laptop. With the invention of CleanMyMac, I can now easily scan and remove malwares away from my laptop and I do it daily. Cyber-attacks can happen to anyone, thus, the best way to protect yourself from being stolen information away is not to click or answer any strange and suspicious emails or URLs. Besides, I have the ambition to turn my game project from an offline game into an online game so keeping personal information for my customers will be the top priority.
